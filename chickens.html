      the <b>chicken</b>(Gallus domesticus) is a large and round 
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">bird</a>, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000
      years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
      others are kept as pets or for cockfighting

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the
      legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[18] Wild
      junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to
      allow them to fly more than a short distance.[2>Description

    <h2>reproduction and lifestyle</h2>
    <p>
      To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a
      hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
      hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she
      responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the
      mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches
      the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive,
      she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with
      both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending
      display.[33]

    <h3>origin</h3>
    <h4>physiology</h4>
    <p>
      Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the
      Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the
      Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene tinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds
      and their dinosaur relatives. <sup><a href="somesource.com">[43]</a></sup>Chickens are descended primarily from
      the red junglefowl
